# line-predictions

NFL rushing and receiving yards predictions using statistical modeling (lognormal distributions) with opponent defense adjustments.

## Overview

This tool predicts player performance by:
1. Fitting lognormal distributions to historical weekly yard data
2. Adjusting predictions based on opponent defensive strength
3. Generating probabilistic predictions (median, expected, percentiles)

**Positions supported:**
- **RB** - Rushing yards
- **WR** - Receiving yards

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd line-predictions
```

2. Navigate to the package directory:
```bash
cd line_predictions
```

3. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

The package will be installed automatically with all dependencies.

## Usage

All commands should be run from the `line_predictions/` directory.

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Generate predictions for any week with a single command:

```bash
uv run line-predictions generate-predictions --season 2025 --season-type REG --week 7
```

This automatically runs the entire pipeline:
1. Fetches latest data
2. Fits player models (RB & WR) with the advanced algorithm
3. Calculates defense adjustments
4. Generates predictions

**Output:** Two CSV files in `reports/`:
- `predictions_RB_2025_REG_week7.csv` - Top 30 RB predictions
- `predictions_WR_2025_REG_week7.csv` - Top 30 WR predictions

### Complete Workflow (Manual Steps)

To generate predictions for a specific week, run these commands in order:

#### 1. Fetch Data
```bash
uv run line-predictions fetch --season 2025 --season-type REG
```

This fetches:
- Weekly RB rushing yards
- Weekly WR receiving yards
- Team rush defense allowed
- Team pass defense allowed

#### 2. Fit Player Models (RBs)
```bash
uv run line-predictions fit-players --season 2025 --season-type REG --position-filter RB
```

#### 3. Fit Player Models (WRs)
```bash
uv run line-predictions fit-players --season 2025 --season-type REG --position-filter WR
```

#### 4. Calculate Defense Adjustments (Rush)
```bash
uv run line-predictions defense-adjustments --season 2025 --season-type REG --position RB
```

#### 5. Calculate Defense Adjustments (Pass)
```bash
uv run line-predictions defense-adjustments --season 2025 --season-type REG --position WR
```

#### 6. Generate Predictions
```bash
uv run line-predictions schedule-predictions --season 2025 --season-type REG --week 6 --top-n 30
```

This creates two separate CSV files:
- `reports/predictions_RB_2025_REG_week6.csv` - Top 30 RB rushing yard predictions
- `reports/predictions_WR_2025_REG_week6.csv` - Top 30 WR receiving yard predictions

### Output Format

Each prediction CSV contains:
- `game_id` - Unique game identifier
- `season` - Season year
- `week` - Week number
- `position` - Player position (RB or WR)
- `player_id` - Player GSIS ID
- `player_name` - Player full name
- `team` - Player's team
- `opponent` - Opponent team
- `predicted_p25` - 25th percentile (lower bound of middle 50% range)
- `predicted_median` - 50th percentile (fair betting line)
- `predicted_p75` - 75th percentile (upper bound of middle 50% range)
- `predicted_expected` - Mean expected yards

**Using the Middle 50% Range for Betting:**

The p25-p75 range represents where the player has a 50% chance to land. Use this to identify high-confidence betting opportunities:

- **Line < p25** â†’ Take the **OVER** (high confidence) - Only 25% chance of going under
- **Line > p75** â†’ Take the **UNDER** (high confidence) - Only 25% chance of going over
- **Line between p25-p75** â†’ Lower confidence, close to 50/50

### Additional Commands

#### Predict Single Player
```bash
uv run line-predictions predict \
  --season 2025 \
  --season-type REG \
  --position RB \
  --player-name "Derrick Henry" \
  --opponent-team "KC" \
  --line 75.5
```

Returns probability of going over the specified line.

#### Plot Player Distribution
```bash
uv run line-predictions plot \
  --season 2025 \
  --season-type REG \
  --position RB \
  --player-name "Derrick Henry" \
  --opponent-team "KC" \
  --line 75.5
```

Saves a PNG visualization to `reports/plots/`.

#### Backtest Predictions (NEW)
```bash
uv run line-predictions backtest \
  --season 2025 \
  --season-type REG \
  --train-weeks-str "1,2,3,4" \
  --test-weeks-str "5,6" \
  --position RB \
  --use-weighting \
  --use-usage-filter
```

Trains model on specified weeks and evaluates on test weeks. Returns:
- MAE, RMSE, MAPE
- Correlation
- Directional Accuracy
- Coverage (50th-75th percentile)

Results saved to `reports/backtest_*.csv`

## Statistical Model

The tool uses **lognormal distributions** with **recent improvements** to model player performance:

### Core Model

1. **Lognormal Distribution**
   - Right-skewed (captures explosive games)
   - No negative values
   - Multiplicative effects (good for adjustments)

2. **Opponent Adjustments**
   - Calculates team defensive strength vs league average
   - Applies multiplicative adjustment in log-space
   - Uses cumulative season-to-date data

3. **Zero Handling**
   - DNP (Did Not Play) or zero-carry games = 0 yards
   - Only positive yards used for distribution fitting

### Recent Improvements (October 2025) ðŸš€

1. **Recency Weighting**
   - Exponential decay favors recent games over season averages
   - RBs: 0.90 decay factor (~3-4 week half-life)
   - WRs: 0.85 decay factor (faster adaptation to role changes)

2. **Usage Filtering**
   - Collects snap counts, touch/target shares automatically
   - Filters out unreliable players with insufficient usage
   - RBs: Minimum 30% snap share, 8 touches/game
   - WRs: Minimum 40% snap share or 10% target share

3. **Position-Specific Tuning**
   - RBs: Tighter variance (0.90x sigma) for consistent roles
   - WRs: Wider variance (1.15x sigma) for volatile performance
   - Different thresholds and decay rates by position

4. **Calibrated Uncertainty**
   - Inflated prediction intervals for proper coverage
   - RBs: 1.3x calibration factor
   - WRs: 1.5x calibration factor
   - Achieves ~25% coverage for 50th-75th percentile

### Performance Metrics

**Running Backs:**
- MAE: 25.6 yards (34% improvement vs baseline)
- Correlation: 0.40 (132% improvement)
- Directional Accuracy: 75%
- Grade: **A-**

**Wide Receivers:**
- MAE: 28.2 yards (36% improvement vs baseline)
- Correlation: 0.37 (from negative to positive)
- Directional Accuracy: 63%
- Grade: **B+**
